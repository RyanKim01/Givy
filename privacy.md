# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 17, 2024

Givy ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Givy mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. 

## Information Collection and Use

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:
- Phone number 
- First name and last name
- Birthday
- Gender
- Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City

We collect this information for the purpose of providing the Service, identifying and communicating with you, responding to your requests/inquiries, and improving our services.

## Phone Number Authentication

When you sign up for an account on Givy, we will collect your phone number. We use your phone number to authenticate your account by sending a one-time password (OTP) via SMS. This ensures only you can access your account.

## Sending Gifts  

When you choose to send a gift to someone through Givy, we will ask you to provide the recipient's phone number. We use this phone number to notify the recipient that you have sent them a gift. The notification is sent via SMS and includes a link for the recipient to download the Givy app to claim their gift. 

In order to claim their gift, the recipient will need to sign up for a Givy account using the phone number that the gift was sent to. We will retain the recipient's phone number as part of their account information.

We may also send additional SMS notifications to the recipient to provide updates on the delivery status of their gift.

## Data Retention

Your phone number used to authenticate your account will be retained as long as you maintain an account with Givy. If you delete your account, we will also delete your phone number.

Phone numbers of gift recipients will be retained indefinitely as they are associated with the recipient's Givy account. If a recipient chooses to delete their Givy account, their phone number will be deleted as well.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 17, 2024 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
